# ML_Pyrite

## Overview
This repository contains data source and codes used in the paper entitled "Machine learning analysis of trace element data reveals 
Neoproterozoic pyrite with both sedimentary and hydrothermal origins" by J. Kang et al. We propose a novel approach using machine
learning with a large LA-ICP-MS pyrite trace element database to distinguish sedimentary and hydrothermal pyrite. The models show 
exceptional performance in predicting the origins of pyrite grains. We also observed four trace element clusters behaving differently 
among sedimentary, synsedimentary hydrothermal, and post-sedimentary hydrothermal pyrite, which is probably driven by chemical and 
physical properties of source fluids, interactions between elements, competition among coprecipitating minerals, and pyrite growth rate. 
Finally, we demonstrated the efficacy of this approach in identifying the origins of Neoproterozoic superheavy pyrite and Ediacaran pyrite
rims associated with fossil-bearing chert nodules. We compiled 1 data source and 4 codes to generate the diagrams in Fig. 2-Fig. 4 and 
supplementary figures. Here is the list of data and code files.
